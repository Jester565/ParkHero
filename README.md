# Park Hero
## The Project
Android & Wear OS application to share photos, choose your next ride, manage FastPasses, and view park schedules for the Disneyland resort. Park Hero is powered by a completely serverless backend written in three languages using over a dozen cloud services from AWS and GCP. "Smart averages" for rides are generated with AWS ML based on a 1.5 years of ride data, weather, and park schedules. These averages are used to generate a ride rating which helps users determine what to ride next. Park Hero offers a profile and friend system for users to view each other's FastPasses and photos. To get FastPasses a user simply has to take a picture of the back of their Disney pass. The pass can then be used to get you into the FastPass line by simply scanning a view on your watch face.
